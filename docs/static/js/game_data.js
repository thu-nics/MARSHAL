The current board state is:\n\n___\n_X_\n___\n\nSo the first row is all empty, the second row has an X in the middle, and the third row is all empty. The legal actions for me are to place an O in any of the remaining cells except (1,1) since that's already taken.

Since the opponent has the center, they might be trying to create a diagonal or a row. My goal is to block them and create my own opportunities.\n\nLooking at the board, the opponent's X is in the center. If I place my O in a corner, maybe that can help me block or set up for a win. Let's consider possible moves.\n\nIf I place O at (0,0), that's a corner. Then the opponent might try to take the opposite corner (2,2) to make a diagonal. But if I take (0,0), maybe I can block their potential lines. Alternatively, placing in the middle of the top row (0,1) might not be as good because that's adjacent to the center.

Now, the other player (X) has placed in (0,1). The current board state is:\n\nOX_\n_X_\n___\n\nSo, row 0 is O, X, _; row 1 is _ , X, _; row 2 is all _.\n\nLegal actions for me are to place O in (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nI need to choose the best move. Let's analyze the board. The opponent (X) has two marks: (1,1) and (0,1). They might be trying to form a line. Let's check possible threats.\n\nLooking at row 0: O, X, _. If X places in (0,2), they would have a row. But I can block that by placing in (0,2). Alternatively, X might be trying to complete a column or diagonal.\n\nLooking at column 1: X is in (0,1) and (1,1). If X places in (2,1), that would be a column. So I need to block that. But in the current state, the legal actions for me are to place in (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So if I place in (2,1), that would block X's potential column.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the diagonal: X is in (1,1) and (0,1). If X places in (2,0), that's not part of a diagonal. Wait, the main diagonals are from (0,0) to (2,2) and (0,2) to (2,0). X is in (1,1), which is the center. If X takes (0,0) or (2,2), they could complete a diagonal. But in the current state, those are empty.\n\nBut the opponent's last move was (0,1). So maybe they are trying to take the top row. If I place in (0,2), that would block them from completing the top row. Alternatively, if I place in (2,1), that would block their column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for opportunities to create my own lines. For example, if I place in (1,0), that's the left side of the middle row. Then, if I can get (1,2) next, that would be a row. But I need to see if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to block X's potential column. Since X has (0,1) and (1,1), if they place in (2,1), that would be a column. So I should place in (2,1) to block that. That would be a good move.\n\nBut let me check the legal actions again. The available moves are (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So (2,1) is allowed. So placing O at (2,1) would block X's column. That seems like a good move. Alternatively, placing in (0,2) would block X's top row.\n\nBut X's last move was (0,1), so they might be aiming for the top row. If I place in (0,2), that would prevent them from completing the top row. But if they take (0,2), then they have two in a row. But since I'm O, I need to block that. So maybe (0,2) is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a central position. But the center is already taken by X. So maybe (1,0) or (1,2) to create a potential line.\n\nWait, if I place in (1,0), then I can later take (1,2) to complete the middle row. But that's two moves away. Alternatively, placing in (2,1) blocks the column.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. The opponent's X is in (0,1) and (1,1). If they take (2,1), that's a column. So I should block that. So placing O in (2,1) is the best move here. That would prevent X from completing the column. So I'll choose that.\n</think><answer><O(2,1)></answer>",

The current board state is:\n\nOX_\n_X_\n___\n\nSo, row 0 is O, X, _; row 1 is _ , X, _; row 2 is all _.\n\nLegal actions for me are to place O in (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nI need to choose the best move. Let's analyze the board. The opponent (X) has two marks: (1,1) and (0,1). They might be trying to form a line. Let's check possible threats.\n\nLooking at row 0: O, X, _. If X places in (0,2), they would have a row. But I can block that by placing in (0,2). Alternatively, X might be trying to complete a column or diagonal.\n\nLooking at column 1: X is in (0,1) and (1,1). If X places in (2,1), that would be a column. So I need to block that. But in the current state, the legal actions for me are to place in (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So if I place in (2,1), that would block X's potential column.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the diagonal: X is in (1,1) and (0,1). If X places in (2,0), that's not part of a diagonal. Wait, the main diagonals are from (0,0) to (2,2) and (0,2) to (2,0). X is in (1,1), which is the center. If X takes (0,0) or (2,2), they could complete a diagonal. But in the current state, those are empty.\n\nBut the opponent's last move was (0,1). So maybe they are trying to take the top row. If I place in (0,2), that would block them from completing the top row. Alternatively, if I place in (2,1), that would block their column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for opportunities to create my own lines. For example, if I place in (1,0), that's the left side of the middle row. Then, if I can get (1,2) next, that would be a row. But I need to see if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to block X's potential column. Since X has (0,1) and (1,1), if they place in (2,1), that would be a column. So I should place in (2,1) to block that. That would be a good move.\n\nBut let me check the legal actions again. The available moves are (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So (2,1) is allowed. So placing O at (2,1) would block X's column. That seems like a good move. Alternatively, placing in (0,2) would block X's top row.\n\nBut X's last move was (0,1), so they might be aiming for the top row. If I place in (0,2), that would prevent them from completing the top row. But if they take (0,2), then they have two in a row. But since I'm O, I need to block that. So maybe (0,2) is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a central position. But the center is already taken by X. So maybe (1,0) or (1,2) to create a potential line.\n\nWait, if I place in (1,0), then I can later take (1,2) to complete the middle row. But that's two moves away. Alternatively, placing in (2,1) blocks the column.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. The opponent's X is in (0,1) and (1,1). If they take (2,1), that's a column. So I should block that. So placing O in (2,1) is the best move here. That would prevent X from completing the column. So I'll choose that.\n</think>\n\n<answer><O(2,1)></answer>",

The legal actions are the empty cells: (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2).\n\nThe opponent (O) just played at (2,1). Let me think about the current state. The opponent has O's at (0,0), (2,1), and (2,2)? Wait, no. Wait the current game state is:\n\nRow 0: O X _\nRow 1: _ X _\nRow 2: _ O _\n\nSo O is at (0,0), (0,1)? Wait no. Wait the first row is O X _, so (0,0) is O, (0,1) is X. Then row 1 is _ X _, so (1,1) is X. Row 2 is _ O _, so (2,1) is O. So O's are at (0,0), (2,1). Wait, and the opponent's last move was (2,1). So the current board has O at (0,0), (2,1), and X at (0,1), (1,1). The empty cells are (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2).\n\nI need to choose the best move. Let's check for possible wins or blocks. The opponent has two O's. Let's see if they can win in the next move. If they take (0,2), they would have O at (0,0), (0,1)? No, (0,1) is X. Wait, O is at (0,0) and (2,1). If they take (0,2), that's the top row. But (0,1) is X, so that's not a line. Alternatively, if they take (2,0) or (2,2), maybe. But since it's my turn, I need to block their possible wins.\n\nAlternatively, I should look for my own opportunities. Let's see. X is at (0,1) and (1,1). If I can take (0,0) or (2,1), but those are already taken. Wait, no. My X's are at (0,1) and (1,1). So if I take (0,0), that's not possible because it's O. Wait, the empty cells are (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2). So I need to choose one of those.\n\nLooking for possible lines. For me, X's are at (0,1) and (1,1). If I take (2,1), that would be a vertical line. But (2,1) is already O. So no. Alternatively, if I take (1,0), that would be part of the middle column. Or (1,2) for the middle row. Wait, the middle row is (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). Since (1,1) is X, if I take (1,0) or (1,2), that would complete the row. But the opponent has O at (2,1). Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take (0,2) to complete a diagonal. The diagonal from (0,0) to (1,1) to (2,2). But (0,0) is O, (1,1) is X, and (2,2) is empty. If I take (2,2), that would be part of that diagonal. But I need to check if that's a good move.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the opponent's possible moves. The opponent has O at (0,0) and (2,1). If they take (0,2), they could have a line in the top row. But (0,1) is X, so that's not possible. Alternatively, if they take (2,0) or (2,2), maybe. But since it's my turn, I should block their possible moves.\n\nSo, if I take (0,2), that would block them from completing the top row. But (0,1) is X, so that's not a line. Wait, the top row is O, X, _. So if O takes (0,2), they would have O, X, O? No, that's not a line. Wait, O is at (0,0), and if they take (0,2), then the top row would be O, X, O. That's not three in a row. So maybe that's not a threat. Alternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to take (2,0) or (2,2) to complete a diagonal or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take (1,0) to block the opponent's possible move. Let's think: if I take (1,0), that would be part of the middle column. The middle column is (0,1) X, (1,1) X, (2,1) O. So that's already two X's and an O. Not a threat. Alternatively, if I take (1,2), that would be part of the middle row. The middle row is (1,0) _, (1,1) X, (1,2) _. If I take (1,2), that would be two X's in the middle row. But I need to check if that's a good move.\n\nWait, the current state is:\n\nRow 0: O X _\nRow 1: _ X _\nRow 2: _ O _\n\nSo, if I take (1,0), that would make the middle column have X at (0,1), X at (1,1), and O at (2,1). So that's not a line. But if I take (1,0), then the middle column would be X, X, O. Not a line. Alternatively, if I take (2,0), that would be part of the bottom row. The bottom row is (2,0), (2,1) O, (2,2). If I take (2,0), then the bottom row would be X, O, _. Not a line. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take (2,2) to start a diagonal. The diagonal from (0,0) O to (1,1) X to (2,2). If I take (2,2), that would be part of that diagonal. But the opponent has O at (2,1). So if I take (2,2), that would be a diagonal with X at (1,1) and (2,2). But that's only two in a row. Not a win yet. But maybe that's a good move to set up for a win.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the best move. The opponent's last move was (2,1). They might be trying to take the bottom row. So if I take (2,0) or (2,2), that would block them. Let's see. If I take (2,0), then the bottom row would be X, O, _. If they take (2,2), they could have O at (2,1) and (2,2), but that's not a line. Alternatively, if I take (2,2), that would be part of the diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to take (1,0) to block the opponent's possible move. Let me think again. The opponent has O at (0,0) and (2,1). If they take (0,2), they can't win. If they take (2,0), then they have O at (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2) would be empty. But if I take (2,2), that would block them. Alternatively, if I take (1,0), that would be part of the middle column. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for my own possible wins. I have X at (0,1) and (1,1). If I take (2,1), that would be a vertical line. But (2,1) is already O. So no. Alternatively, if I take (0,0) or (2,2), but those are already taken by O. So maybe the best move is to take (1,2) to complete the middle row. The middle row is (1,0), (1,1) X, (1,2). If I take (1,2), then that would be two X's in the middle row. But I need to check if that's a good move. Alternatively, if I take (1,0), that would be part of the middle column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to take (0,2) to block the opponent's possible move. Let me think: if the opponent takes (0,2), they would have O at (0,0), (0,2), but (0,1) is X. So that's not a line. So maybe that's not a threat. So maybe I should take (1,2) to complete the middle row. Let's say I take (1,2). Then the middle row would be (1,0) _, (1,1) X, (1,2) X. So that's two X's. But not a win yet. However, if I take (1,0) next, that would complete the middle row. But that's not immediate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to take (2,2) to start a diagonal. So I'll choose X(2,2). That would be a good move to set up for a diagonal. So the answer is X(2,2).\n</think><answer><X(2,2)></answer>",

Let's think about possible moves.\n\nIf I place O in (0,2), that would block X from completing the top row (OX_) by adding O in (0,2), making it OXO. But X could still try to take (2,0) to complete the diagonal. Alternatively, if I place in (2,0), that would block X's potential diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the middle row: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). X is in (1,1).

But currently, (0,2) is empty and (2,0) is empty.\n\nLooking at rows and columns: Row 0 has O, X, _. If X places in (0,2), they would have a row. But I can block that by placing in (0,2). Column 2 has _, _, X. If X places in (0,2) or (2,0), they could complete the column. But I need to check.\n\nThe opponent's last move was X(2,2). Now, the available moves for me are (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0). Let's think about possible moves.\n\nIf I place O in (0,2), that would block X from completing the top row (OX_) by adding O in (0,2), making it OXO. But X could still try to take (2,0) to complete the diagonal. Alternatively, if I place in (2,0), that would block X's potential diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the middle row: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). X is in (1,1). If I place in (1,0) or (1,2), that could help me create a line. But I need to see if that's possible.\n\nWait, the current board has X in (0,1), (1,1), (2,2). If X takes (0,2) and (2,0), they would have a diagonal. So I need to block that. So placing O in (0,2) or (2,0) would block that.\n\nBut the legal actions are (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0). Let's consider each:\n\n- (0,2): Blocks X from completing the top row and the diagonal.\n- (2,0): Blocks X from completing the diagonal.\n- (1,0) or (1,2): Might help in creating a middle row or column, but not sure.\n\nSince X is trying to complete the diagonal (0,2)-(1,1)-(2,0), I should block that. So placing O in (0,2) or (2,0). Which is better?\n\nIf I place in (0,2), then X can't complete the diagonal. If I place in (2,0), same thing. But considering the current state, maybe (0,2) is more critical because X is already in (0,1) and (1,1). If I take (0,2), that would block their potential row and diagonal. Alternatively, (2,0) would block the diagonal.\n\nBut looking at the board, the opponent's last move was (2,2). So maybe they are focusing on the diagonal. So blocking that is important. Let's choose (0,2) to block the top row and the diagonal. Alternatively, (2,0) to block the diagonal.\n\nBut the opponent might try to take (0,2) next. If I take (0,2), then X can't complete the diagonal. So I'll go with (0,2).\n</think>\n\n<answer><O(0,2)></answer>",

Alternatively, if I take (1,0), that could help in the middle column. But maybe the best move is to take (0,1) to block the opponent's potential win. So I'll choose X(0,1).\n</think>\n\n<answer><X(0,1)></answer>",

The legal actions are the empty cells: (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2).\n\nThe opponent (O) just played at (2,1). Let me think about the current state. The opponent has O's at (0,0), (2,1), and (2,2)? Wait, no. Wait the current game state is:\n\nRow 0: O X _\nRow 1: _ X _\nRow 2: _ O _\n\nSo O is at (0,0), (0,1)? Wait no. Wait the first row is O X _, so (0,0) is O, (0,1) is X. Then row 1 is _ X _, so (1,1) is X. Row 2 is _ O _, so (2,1) is O. So O's are at (0,0), (2,1). Wait, and the opponent's last move was (2,1). So the current board has O at (0,0), (2,1), and X at (0,1), (1,1). The empty cells are (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2).\n\nI need to choose the best move. Let's check for possible wins or blocks. The opponent has two O's. Let's see if they can win in the next move. If they take (0,2), they would have O at (0,0), (0,1)? No, (0,1) is X. Wait, O is at (0,0) and (2,1). If they take (0,2), that's the top row. But (0,1) is X, so that's not a line. Alternatively, if they take (2,0) or (2,2), maybe. But since it's my turn, I need to block their possible wins.\n\nAlternatively, I should look for my own opportunities. Let's see. X is at (0,1) and (1,1). If I can take (0,0) or (2,1), but those are already taken. Wait, no. My X's are at (0,1) and (1,1). So if I take (0,0), that's not possible because it's O. Wait, the empty cells are (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2). So I need to choose one of those.\n\nLooking for possible lines. For me, X's are at (0,1) and (1,1). If I take (2,1), that would be a vertical line. But (2,1) is already O. So no. Alternatively, if I take (1,0), that would be part of the middle column. Or (1,2) for the middle row. Wait, the middle row is (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). Since (1,1) is X, if I take (1,0) or (1,2), that would complete the row. But the opponent has O at (2,1). Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take (0,2) to complete a diagonal. The diagonal from (0,0) to (1,1) to (2,2). But (0,0) is O, (1,1) is X, and (2,2) is empty. If I take (2,2), that would be part of that diagonal. But I need to check if that's a good move.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the opponent's possible moves. The opponent has O at (0,0) and (2,1). If they take (0,2), they could have a line in the top row. But (0,1) is X, so that's not possible. Alternatively, if they take (2,0) or (2,2), maybe. But since it's my turn, I should block their possible moves.\n\nSo, if I take (0,2), that would block them from completing the top row. But (0,1) is X, so that's not a line. Wait, the top row is O, X, _. So if O takes (0,2), they would have O, X, O? No, that's not a line. Wait, O is at (0,0), and if they take (0,2), then the top row would be O, X, O. That's not three in a row. So maybe that's not a threat. Alternatively, maybe the opponent is trying to take (2,0) or (2,2) to complete a diagonal or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take (1,0) to block the opponent's possible move. Let's think: if I take (1,0), that would be part of the middle column. The middle column is (0,1) X, (1,1) X, (2,1) O. So that's already two X's and an O. Not a threat. Alternatively, if I take (1,2), that would be part of the middle row. The middle row is (1,0) _, (1,1) X, (1,2) _. If I take (1,2), that would be two X's in the middle row. But I need to check if that's a good move.\n\nWait, the current state is:\n\nRow 0: O X _\nRow 1: _ X _\nRow 2: _ O _\n\nSo, if I take (1,0), that would make the middle column have X at (0,1), X at (1,1), and O at (2,1). So that's not a line. But if I take (1,0), then the middle column would be X, X, O. Not a line. Alternatively, if I take (2,0), that would be part of the bottom row. The bottom row is (2,0), (2,1) O, (2,2). If I take (2,0), then the bottom row would be X, O, _. Not a line. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should take (2,2) to start a diagonal. The diagonal from (0,0) O to (1,1) X to (2,2). If I take (2,2), that would be part of that diagonal. But the opponent has O at (2,1). So if I take (2,2), that would be a diagonal with X at (1,1) and (2,2). But that's only two in a row. Not a win yet. But maybe that's a good move to set up for a win.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the best move. The opponent's last move was (2,1). They might be trying to take the bottom row. So if I take (2,0) or (2,2), that would block them. Let's see. If I take (2,0), then the bottom row would be X, O, _. If they take (2,2), they could have O at (2,1) and (2,2), but that's not a line. Alternatively, if I take (2,2), that would be part of the diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to take (1,0) to block the opponent's possible move. Let me think again. The opponent has O at (0,0) and (2,1). If they take (0,2), they can't win. If they take (2,0), then they have O at (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2) would be empty. But if I take (2,2), that would block them. Alternatively, if I take (1,0), that would be part of the middle column. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for my own possible wins. I have X at (0,1) and (1,1). If I take (2,1), that would be a vertical line. But (2,1) is already O. So no. Alternatively, if I take (0,0) or (2,2), but those are already taken by O. So maybe the best move is to take (1,2) to complete the middle row. The middle row is (1,0), (1,1) X, (1,2). If I take (1,2), then that would be two X's in the middle row. But I need to check if that's a good move. Alternatively, if I take (1,0), that would be part of the middle column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to take (0,2) to block the opponent's possible move. Let me think: if the opponent takes (0,2), they would have O at (0,0), (0,2), but (0,1) is X. So that's not a line. So maybe that's not a threat. So maybe I should take (1,2) to complete the middle row. Let's say I take (1,2). Then the middle row would be (1,0) _, (1,1) X, (1,2) X. So that's two X's. But not a win yet. However, if I take (1,0) next, that would complete the middle row. But that's not immediate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to take (2,2) to start a diagonal. So I'll choose X(2,2). That would be a good move to set up for a diagonal. So the answer is X(2,2).\n</think><answer><X(2,2)></answer>",

But considering the current state, maybe (0,2) is more critical because X is already in (0,1) and (1,1). If I take (0,2), that would block their potential row and diagonal. Alternatively, (2,0) would block the diagonal.\n\nBut looking at the board, the opponent's last move was (2,2). So maybe they are focusing on the diagonal. So blocking that is important. Let's choose (0,2) to block the top row and the diagonal. Alternatively, (2,0) to block the diagonal.\n\nBut the opponent might try to take (0,2) next. If I take (0,2), then X can't complete the diagonal. So I'll go with (0,2).\n</think>\n\n<answer><O(0,2)></answer>",
